Propose two testing protocols:
(1)   Standardize these protocols for clinical and public use as formal tools for risk screening, medical treatment, and exercise training.
(2)   Establish data-driven models to improve risk stratification and personalized interventions. 

Proposed protocols
(1)   6 minute walking test, 12 minute walking test, and 30-minute walking tests
•   Rationale: 
6MWT stems from cardiac rehabilitation, for patients with CAD, heart failure, and COPD. it is not sensitive for healthy adults, and adults with other types of chronic diseases. However, there is no standard for walking capacity for healthy adults. Could we establish 30-minute walking test for healthy adults, so as to identify those at risk of chronic diseases? 
•   Application:
walking tests from 6 MWT, 12 MWT, 30-minutes walking distance, with gait metrics (stride, speed) could identify early declines in mobility or subclinical vascular impairment.  
 
(2)   30-minute moderate-intensity aerobic exercise (cycle ergometer)
•   Rationale: 
Moderate-intensity cycling is safe, physiologically reproducible. It could provide reliable data on aerobic capacity (METs) and hemodynamic responses (CBF, BPV)
•   Application 
30-min bicycle ergometer exercise, at moderate intensity, could serve as a formal test in clinical settings. The results (METs, CBF) from healthy adults could be established as a standard. 
 
Scientific and practical value 
•   Standardization benefits
We could consistently collect right and useful data and facilitate large-scale analytics. 
•   Long-term vision 
Integration with big data could refine the power of the models for early intervention, and personized exercise prescription
