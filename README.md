The points I want to discuss with the public is: intensive exercise training may impair brain health. Heart-to-brain dual systems should be considered together in many occasions. 
 
I am assuming that it’s worthy of the attention for the researchers working on brain health and cardiovascular health.
 
The key information is we need to consider the heart-to-brain hemodynamics together, because intensive hemodynamic variation, particularly during intensive exercise, may impair cerebral structure and function. 
•       The limited associations between cardiorespiratory fitness and cerebral hemodynamics, challenging the traditional view “strong cardiorespiratory fitness, strong brain”. 
•       Intensive aerobic training, particularly HIIT, may induce cerebral impairment, particularly in hippocampal structure and volume, because hippocampus is vulnerable to mechanical stress and hemodynamic variation. 
•       Cerebral pulsatility, central arterial stiffness are independent and critical risk factors for brain structure. 
•       Thus, a separate set of exercise testing, and physical performance, reflecting brain health, independent of cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF), is critical.   
 
Knowledge gap in the current exercise testing system: 
- The unit of defining CRF is based on the oxygen use, leading to potential variations of CRF across different organs (heart, brain, kidney…). 
- Mechanical hemodynamics are not defined or incorporated into equation of CRF.
